A responsive webservices site using html and css

I have made a responsive webservices website . In this project i tried using modern css with html such as, css variables, css grid, flexbox and media queries to make it responsive. 
css gird was used mainly for the layout of my website.

Following are the bullet points about this project: 
1) Used css variable to maintain the color scheme in this project.
2) I have used css grid mostly for the layout of my website, whole wraper(refer index.html file) class is given the display grid, and all the conainer 
   within it are made grid such as (top-container, boxes, navbar, image-gallary) as well. 
3) grid template area is used for giving it layout.
4) Used flexbox to align my content within grid items.
5) Used media queries to make it responsive suited to mobile and laptop.
